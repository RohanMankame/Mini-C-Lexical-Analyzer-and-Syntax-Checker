# Mini-C-Lexical-Analyzer-and-Syntax-Checker
This project implements the lexical analysis (tokenizing) and syntax checking (parsing) phases of a compiler for a simplified C-like programming language, referred to as "Mini-C.". It demonstrates fundamental compiler design principles, including tokenization, recursive-descent parsing, and parse tree generation.
